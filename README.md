# The Simple TALL-CRM

A minimalistic **open-source CRM** built with the **TALL stack** (Tailwind, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire).  
The goal of this project is to design a **clear, optimized, and easy-to-use foundation** for a CRM, without the complexity of larger platforms.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Build a simple CRM focused on clarity and efficiency.
- Optimize structure and performance for modern Laravel projects.
- Document the development process transparently as a devlog.
- Provide a base that can be extended and improved by the community.
